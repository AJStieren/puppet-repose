# == Class: repose::tomcat7
#
# This class is able to install or remove repose
# for tomcat7 on a node.
#
# === Parameters
#
# [*ensure*]
# String. Controls if the managed resources shall be <tt>present</tt> or
# <tt>absent</tt>. If set to <tt>absent</tt>:
# * The managed software packages are being uninstalled.
# * Any traces of the packages will be purged as good as possible. This may
# include existing configuration files. The exact behavior is provider
# dependent. Q.v.:
# * Puppet type reference: {package, "purgeable"}[http://j.mp/xbxmNP]
# * {Puppet's package provider source code}[http://j.mp/wtVCaL]
# * System modifications (if any) will be reverted as good as possible
# (e.g. removal of created users, services, changed log settings, ...).
# * This is thus destructive and should be used with care.
# Defaults to <tt>present</tt>.
#
# [*enable*]
# Bool/String. Controls if the managed service shall be running(<tt>true</tt>),
# stopped(<tt>false</tt>), or <tt>manual</tt>. This affects the service state
# at both boot and during runtime.  If set to <tt>manual</tt> Puppet will
# ignore the state of the service.
# Defaults to <tt>true</tt>.
#
# [*autoupgrade*]
# Boolean. If set to <tt>true</tt>, any managed package gets upgraded
# on each Puppet run when the package provider is able to find a newer
# version than the present one. The exact behavior is provider dependent.
# Q.v.:
# * Puppet type reference: {package, "upgradeable"}[http://j.mp/xbxmNP]
# * {Puppet's package provider source code}[http://j.mp/wtVCaL]
# Defaults to <tt>false</tt>.
#
# The default values for the parameters are set in repose::params. Have
# a look at the corresponding <tt>params.pp</tt> manifest file if you need more
# technical information about them.
